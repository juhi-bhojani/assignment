Commit squashing is the process of combining multiple commits into a single, more meaningful commit. 

Steps to restructure commit history:

STEP 1: Rebase to a previous desired commit with interactive mode
            git rebase -i head~10 (refers to 10th commit before current)

STEP 2: Pick a certain commit and they squash other commits necessary along with altering messages
            git pick <commit-hash> <commit-message>
            git squash <commit-hash> <commit-message>
            git squash <commit-hash> <commit-message>
        Git allows editing the final text message

STEP 3: Force push to remote which will rewrite the history
            git push --force
