Throttling limits the number of times a function is executed over a certain time period.
throttle uses the time delay to execute the callback function at regular intervals until the event trigger is active.


Debouncing is a technique that delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last event's occurrence.
It delays the function invocation by a defined period of time to avoid unnecessary invocations.


Use Cases:
Throttling : handling scroll events or resizing events
Debouncing : search suggestions
