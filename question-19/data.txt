Git submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. 
When adding a submodule to a repository a new .gitmodules file will be created. 

Git submodule is something like a repository inside another git repository.

Steps to add a git submodule:
1. git submodule add "link to github repository"
2. git submodule status


Why use git submodule?

If you need to maintain a strict version management over your external dependencies,  it can make sense to use Git submodules. The following are a few best use cases for Git submodules.

    a. When an external component or subproject is changing too fast or upcoming changes will break the API, you can lock the code to a specific commit for your own safety.
    b. When you have a component that isnâ€™t updated very often and you want to track it as a vendor dependency.
    c. When you are delegating a piece of the project to a third party and you want to integrate their work at a specific time or release. Again this works when updates are not too frequent.


Git submodule can also be used to make specific changes to an external library.
It can also be used to divide a project into multiple component and integrate using git submodules
